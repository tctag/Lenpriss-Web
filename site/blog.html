      <p>You Must decide if you are going to rob the world or bless it with the rich, valuable, potent, untapped resources locked away within You- Myles Munroe.
Dear friend, bet you did not know that my first degree is in English and Literary Studies from the only university in the world, the Great University of Ibadan,(actually, UI&others).
Not sure you know that I am a newspaper columnist.
<p>You also may not know that I offer excellent editorial reviews of best selling books.
I have been privileged to sit on a panel with some of the world's best dons, Professor Pat Utomi and Professor Chukwuma Soludo.
In my sojourn on earth, I have learnt that every creature is a reservoir of endowments which are largely untapped. Sadly, waiting to be buried at the death of the bearer.
Only a few manage to contribute the quota to the knowledge base. The truth is that many of us are robbers, o yes, we bear no ammunition, we decline to make the world a better place than we met it by opening up the resources the creator has generously embedded in us.
My late father, Ezinna Leonard Okereafor was regarded as an institution, with only very basic education, he exuded much more intelligence than Doctorate degree holders. He had every date in his head, he could recall incidents of over 7 decades with absolute clarity, he was a moving encyclopedia.
In resolving communal cases my father used to put his judgement in writing. </p>

<p>He was the final authority in nearly every dispute. Tragedy, he never wrote a book! The community bemoans his absence in their lack lustre kindred gatherings where things have fallen apart because the fore fathers failed to pull their innate resources into a permanent pool from which forebears would drink from.
Abba Kari, late Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari has left his family and admirers with the burden of history, the weight would have been lighter if he bequeathed a robust account from his prism.
Frontline journalist and author, Olusegun Adeniyi once insisted that every leader has a responsibility to give account of Stewardship in book form.</p>
<p>For the sake pf posterity, necessity is equally laid on you to provide a reference material drawing from your wealth of experience in whatever field of endeavour.
Interestingly, the burgeoning of best selling authors of Nigerian descent on Amazon is a thing of national pride.
Gone are the ways when information is concealed in a book for the African. Many Nigerians are voracious readers. The assertion that readers are leaders holds true for many.
That way I can review your book and pay my bills.</p>
